description: In this project we developed a virtual reality environment to check which sort of robot could help users in a high risk situation to evacuate most efficiently. We tracked their movement and analyzed the users movement in virtual reality. Check out our [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/qrno98/HRI_RescueRobot/-/tree/main/documentation) and our [Report](https://gitlab.com/qrno98/HRI_RescueRobot/-/blob/main/documentation/BotFire_Comparing_Visual_vs_Audio_Cues_for_an_Fire_Evacuation_Bot.pdf)
